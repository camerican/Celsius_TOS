2. Definitions

Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to them in these Terms, unless the context requires otherwise.

“Affiliate” means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is or under common control or ownership with a party, where control is defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such party, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

“Blockchain” means a system in which records of transactions made in Digital Assets are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

“Digital Asset” means a digital representation of value in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of digital units and verify the transfer of assets, operating independently from a central bank.

“Eligible Digital Assets” means the types of Digital Assets we may choose to accept and support from time to time, which are subject to change in our sole discretion, based on business and regulatory considerations.

“Fiat”, when used in reference to money or currency, means any money that a recognized government declares as legal tender, and has value only because such government maintains its value.

3. Eligibility and Proof of Identity

You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to open a Celsius Account (“Account”). Celsius is not obligated to accept any application from any applicant and has sole and absolute discretion to accept or reject applications to open Accounts. Celsius has no responsibility or liability towards any applicant unless and until Celsius provides written confirmation that an Account has been opened for such an applicant.

Celsius Accounts are not available where prohibited by law or by Celsius policy, as updated from time to time; currently, such places include the countries of Iran, North Korea, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Cuba, or any other country against which the United States, the United Kingdom or the European Union imposes financial sanctions or embargoes.  

Be advised that in some jurisdictions, due to regulatory considerations, Celsius may not provide part or all of the Services, which may include some Eligible Digital Currencies or the CEL token.

Due to changing regulatory requirements and interpretations in the Digital Assets markets, Celsius will use its sole and absolute discretion to revise the list of prohibited jurisdictions and/or reject specific applications to open Accounts and/or use part or all of the Services, where Celsius determines that regulatory or policy reasons prevent Celsius from being able to offer its Services.

Celsius registered as a Money Service Business (“MSB”) on April 15, 2018 with FinCEN registration number 31000122237406. As an MSB, Celsius is required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting suspicious transactions. User records and transaction history must be retained by Celsius for a period of five (5) years (seven years for New York users) after the termination of the business relationship (or the refusal to establish the business relationship), unless otherwise required by applicable law. Celsius is required to comply with applicable Anti Money Laundering (“AML”) and Know Your Client (“KYC”) requirements before and after you open an Account. When you apply to open an Account, we will ask for documentation and information, including but not limited to copies of your government-issued identification document (e.g. Passport, driver’s license). For corporate accounts, we may require identification information related to the directors, officers, or equity owners of the business.  We may also use information from third parties to help us confirm your identity and/or determine if we should open or maintain your Account. You represent and warrant at all times that any and all information provided by you to us is true, accurate, and not misleading in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to provide the new information to us as soon as practicable following such change.

4. Nature of e-Services

Celsius’ Services allow you to review your Account and conduct certain transactions online. You are solely responsible for the activities under your Account and for securing your Account IDs, passwords, hints, or any other codes that you use to access your Account and the Services. Celsius is not responsible for any loss or compromise of your access information and/or your personal information, or for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of your access information and/or personal information.

We will not be liable for following any instruction we receive through your Account, even if it was not authorized by you, or if it was entered by mistake or is otherwise inaccurate. To verify the authenticity of any instruction we receive through your Account, we may require your signature or identification in any form we deem necessary; at our sole discretion, we may accept digital images and electronic signatures for documents that need to be signed.  You agree to reimburse us (and we may charge your Account) for all claims, costs, losses and damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that result from our following of your instructions to take any action related to your Account.

5. Account Types

   A) Individual Account

This Account is owned by only one natural person who is and will continue to be the only person authorized to take any action in the Account. By opening an Individual Account, you represent and warrant that you are and shall at all times continue to be the sole beneficial owner of the Account and user of all Services facilitated or generated therefrom.

   B) Corporate Account

This Account is owned by a corporation, unincorporated association, a company, a partnership, fiduciary, sole proprietorship or other legally recognized group (interchangeably defined as an “Entity”) holding an Account in any capacity other than an individual capacity. An Entity can apply to open an Account through any natural person(s) who is duly authorized by the Entity to do so (an “Authorized Representative“).

Such Authorized Representative represents and agrees, on behalf of the Entity, as well as on his or her own behalf, that he or she:

    (i). is fully authorized to execute all documents or otherwise complete our requirements in his or her stated capacity;

    (ii). has provided us all documents or other information necessary to demonstrate that authority; and

    (iii). will provide other documents and complete other requirements as we may request from time to time.

We may refuse to recognize any such authorization if, in our reasonable judgment, it appears to be incomplete or improperly executed.

By opening a Corporate Account, the Authorized Representative  represents and warrants on behalf of the Entity that the Entity is and shall at all times continue to be the sole beneficial owner of the Account and user of all Services facilitated or generated therefrom and that the ultimate beneficial owners of all assets and assets belonging to the Entity are as represented during the establishment of the Account.

6. Authorized Users

For both Individual Accounts and Corporate Accounts, we may follow any instructions regarding your Account provided that we reasonably believe such instructions are authorized by the Account holder.

7. Contributions

All contributions to your Account must consist of Eligible Digital Assets and must be transferred to the wallet address provided in your Celsius Account (or as otherwise notified by us to you). We reserve the right to reject any transaction, and/or the right to return any Digital Asset already made, each at your expense. Any Digital Asset received will be treated by us as being received at the date and time stamped on the blockchain confirmation.

8. Ownership of Digital Assets

You hereby represent and warrant to us at all times during which you hold Digital Assets in your Account that any Digital Asset used by you in connection with your Account is owned by you or that you are validly authorized to carry out transactions using such Digital Assets, and that all transactions initiated with your Account are for your own Account and not on behalf of any other person or entity. You further represent and warrant that all such Digital Assets are free from any claims, indebtedness, liens, or third-party interests.

9. Setoff and Security Interest Rights

You grant us a security interest in any and all of your Accounts for debts, amounts owed, or liabilities incurred (“Obligations”) to us or any of our affiliates by any owner of any of your Accounts. Obligations may include both secured and unsecured debts, and Obligations you owe individually or together with someone else, including Obligations under other transactions or agreements between you and us or any of our Affiliates. 

We may take or set off assets in any or all of your Accounts, or transfer assets between any or all of your Accounts with us or any of our Affiliates for direct, indirect, and acquired Obligations that you owe us or our Affiliates, including any balances as a result of not having sufficient assets available, regardless of the source of assets in an Account. These rights are in addition to other rights we have to take, transfer, or charge assets in your Accounts for Obligations you owe us or our Affiliates.

Your acceptance of these Terms serves as your consent to Celsius’ asserting its security interest or exercising its right of setoff should any laws governing your Account require your consent. If the law restricts our ability to take, transfer, or setoff assets in your Account, or if some Digital Assets are protected from attachment, levy, or legal process, you waive those conditions and limits to the full extent that you may do so by contract, and you authorize us to apply assets in any or all of your Accounts to your Obligations.

We hereby agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you may take or set off assets in your Account, or any amounts we owe you with respect thereto, against the Obligations. If the law restricts your ability to take, transfer, or setoff assets in your Account, or if some Digital Assets are protected from attachment, levy, or legal process, we waive those conditions and limits to the full extent that we may do so by contract, and we authorize you to apply assets in any or all of your Accounts to your Obligations.

10. Risk Disclosure

These Terms and the holding of Digital Asset relationship does not create a fiduciary relationship between us and you; your Account is not a checking or savings account, and it is not covered by insurance against losses. We may lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of assets and Eligible Digital Assets to counterparties or hold the Eligible Digital Assets with counterparties, and we will use our best commercial and operational efforts to prevent losses. 

ELIGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS ARE NOT LEGAL TENDER. CELSIUS IS NOT A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, AND YOUR CELSIUS WALLET IS NOT A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. ELIGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS IN YOUR CELSIUS WALLET ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) OR THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION (SIPC).

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets. Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Any secured account maintained by Celsius for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.

The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Digital Assets for Fiat currencies or other Digital Assets. If such willingness is abolished for any reason, this may result in the potential for a permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset.

The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, including rollback attacks or Blockchain reorganizations. The nature of Digital Assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by Celsius may prevent the access or use of your Digital Assets and/or cause losses of Digital Assets. 

Although Celsius takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber threats, circumstances may arise where losses or damages incur. In that event, you authorize Celsius to use Eligible Digital Assets to absorb the remaining losses.

In light of these risks, which are only some of the risks involved in using the Services and holding or trading in Digital Assets, and do not constitute an exhaustive list of such risks, you should carefully consider whether holding or trading Digital Assets in general and/or using our Services is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.

11. Holding Eligible Digital Assets

You can hold Eligible Digital Assets to your Account by transferring Eligible Digital Assets to the address provided by Celsius. The transfer of such Eligible Digital Assets to your Account will not be deemed settled and completed until the blockchain transaction is deemed confirmed to the relevant address.

12. Withdrawals

You may make a complete or partial withdrawal of Eligible Digital Assets from your Account at any time. Celsius initiates the withdrawal process immediately following a withdrawal request when possible; however, we may require up to three (3) days after you submit your withdrawal request to process the withdrawal. 

For every withdrawal request, you will be required to provide the details of the wallet to which you wish to transfer your Digital Assets. In the event that the details you provide are inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, your Digital Assets may be permanently lost. We will not be liable for any loss that results from inaccurate, incomplete or misleading details that you may provide for such transfer. If the transfer address you specify is one to which we are unable to process transfers, we will have no liability for any resulting failure or delay in processing your requested withdrawal.

Celsius and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of transactions s either temporarily or permanently. Provided that Celsius has taken reasonable commercial and operational measures to prevent such events in technical systems controlled by Celsius, Celsius is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transactions. Withdrawal limits based on amounts and/or frequency may apply from time to time and will be described in your Account interface. Users can withdraw any amount at any time; however, our policies may require additional security checks that require up to 48 hours to complete. Any individual request to exceed withdrawal limits set by Celsius must be sent via email to app@celsius.network.

Every transmission request shall be deemed pending until accepted by us. We may refuse to accept such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to insufficient assets in your Account, inaccurate or misleading information provided by you, or any doubt or suspicion of money laundering or other financial crime related to your Account.

Where you transmit only a part of the Eligible Digital Assets available in your Account, the transmitted Eligible Digital Assets will include first the principal amount (i.e. assets transmitted by you) and only after these are transmitted in full, any paid rewards may be transmitted.

13. How Rewards Are Calculated and Earned

All Eligible Digital Assets that (1) are not being used as collateral for loans; (2)  were not transferred to another Celsius user using CelPay, and (3) were not requested for external transmission (Eligible Digital Assets meeting each of these three criteria, “Held Digital Assets“) entitle you to rewards while held with Celsius. Held Digital Assets in suspended accounts, for legal or other reasons, are not eligible for rewards. 

We occasionally update our rates and the rate changes are based on market conditions. Rewards will be payable in arrears and added to your Account weekly. We calculate the rewards on your Held Digital Assets based on market demand. 

Interest is gained based on a daily periodic rate to the Held Digital Assets in the Account. The daily periodic rate is calculated by dividing the applicable interest rate (APR) by three hundred sixty-four (364) days; then it is further divided down to the hour, minute, and second of that day. Held Digital Assets, including those received as reward from previous weeks, will begin gaining rewards according to the hour, minute, and second on the timestamp verifying the completion of the applicable transaction and shall cease and/or decrease the amount paid as rewards at the moment when the User has entered an external transmission and/or transfer (via CelPay) request. Therefore, any Eligible Digital Asset made mid-week will receive rewards with no distinction, based on the interest calculated for the relative time within the allocation period.

We will credit your Account with the rewards earned for the previous week on or around the first business day of each week. Your Account must be open on the date the credit is earned for you to receive the applicable rewards. All rewards will be paid in-kind (in the same Eligible Digital Asset that is available in your Account) or, subject to your in-app choice and regulatory and business considerations, in CEL. To make such in-kind interest payments as accurately as possible, Celsius rounds non-integer, rational numbers to the sub-cent, which is the smallest possible decimal available for the applicable Eligible Digital Asset.

For users who are citizens or legal residents of the United States, Celsius requires your Taxpayer ID (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) to be updated in your Celsius user profile in order to gain rewards on your Held Digital Assets. Celsius is not obligated to credit your Account retroactively with rewards that would have been gained if you had otherwise updated your profile with your TIN or SSN.

If for any regulatory or legal reason we are limited in the rewards rate we may offer you (or if we are completely restricted from paying any rewards to you whatsoever), the rewards to which you shall be entitled will be limited accordingly. Based on our reasonable interpretation of legal requirements, without prior notice, we may limit the rewards to which you will be entitled. 

14. Consent to Celsius’ Use of Your Digital Assets

In consideration for the rewards earned on your Account and the use of our Services, you grant Celsius the right, subject to applicable law, without further notice to you, to hold the Digital Assets available in your account in Celsius’ name or in another name, and to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time, and without retaining in Celsius’ possession and/or control a like amount of Digital Assets or any other monies or assets, and to use or invest such Digital Assets. You acknowledge that with respect to assets used by Celsius pursuant to this paragraph:

    (i) You may not be able to exercise certain rights of ownership; 

    (ii) Celsius may receive compensation in connection with lending or otherwise using Digital Assets in its business to which you have no claim or entitlement;

    (iii) Celsius borrowers may default partially or entirely, which can result in partial or total loss of your coins. In that event, you authorize Celsius to use Eligible Digital Assets to absorb the remaining losses;

    (iv) Celsius may use your Eligible Digital Assets as collateral to borrow other digital or fiat assets in different jurisdictions around the world. While such borrowing are for the purpose of optimizing the returns to all members, Celsius may experience losses or partial recovery of such collateral in certain situations.

    (v) You authorize Celsius to use Eligible Digital Assets to absorb the remaining losses; and,

    (vi) Celsius may lend your coins to exchanges, hedge   and other counterparties, which may provide full or partial collateral for any coin or fiat loan.

15. Hard Forks

Any Blockchain may undergo software updates from time to time, which will result in a permanent divergence in the Blockchain (a “Hard Fork”). The result is such Blockchain will split into two separate and distinct Blockchains, and any Digital Asset on that original Blockchain may entitle its holders to a new type of Digital Asset (the “New Currency”). Due to the administrative complexity of being the repository for a hard-forked Digital Asset, the support of any New Currency in your Account is solely at the discretion of Celsius. If we make no public announcement regarding an anticipated Hard Fork, we will not support the New Currency and will be an unsupported currency (“Unsupported Currencies)”), in which case all Accounts will be denominated in the legacy Digital Asset and all rewards will accrue in the legacy Digital Asset. You agree that Celsius assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to those Unsupported Currencies and You will not be able to recover the Unsupported Currencies from Celsius. Celsius assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever with respect to Unsupported Currencies.

In the event that a Hard Fork achieves the required consensus, it is possible that we will only support the New Currency and will discontinue our support of the legacy Digital Asset. In the event of a Hard Fork that entitles you to a New Currency, you are advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from your Account prior to the date of the Hard Fork. Celsius is not obligated in any way to monitor or maintain balances of New Currency issued to holders of the applicable Digital Assets upon a Hard Fork, or to credit you for the value of such New Currency. In the event you wish to receive New Currency issued upon a Hard Fork, you are advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from your Account prior to the date of the Hard Fork. All determinations regarding Hard Forks shall be made by Celsius in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with applicable law.

16. CelPay

CelPay is Celsius’ proprietary Digital Asset payment tool for mobile applications. CelPay allows you to send payments in supported Digital Assets (currently BTC and ETH) to other registered Users. 

By using our CelPay feature, you understand and acknowledge that:

    (i) transfers of Eligible Digital Assets by CelPay are not recorded on any blockchain, but rather on Celsius’ books;

    (ii) any payment sent to the wrong User may be irrevocably lost, and it is your sole responsibility to make sure you provide the correct address;

    (iii) the completion of a transfer may not be immediate, and it may take some time before the transfer is processed and the payee’s account is credited;

    (iv) use of the CelPay feature is subject to limitations on amounts transferred, as determined in Celsius’ reasonable discretion from time to time;

    (v) all CelPay transfers are final and irreversible;

    (vi) you are familiar with the person to whom payment is made, and that such payment is not made for any illicit or illegal purpose.

Celsius does not accept any liability for transfers or attempted transfers would violate any law or regulation, including without limitation, KYC requirements, embargoed or restricted persons or locations, prohibitions against money laundering and/or anti-bribery laws, and structured transactions or tax evasion, and Celsius may refuse to perform, block, or otherwise void any transfers that Celsius reasonably believes could violate any law or regulation.

17. Taxes

Within Celsius’ platform, you will be able to see a record of the transactions related to your Account which you may wish to use for the purposes of making any required tax filings or payments. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. We may deduct or make any tax withholdings or filings that we are required by law to make, but we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction. You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that Celsius is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax law. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your Account.

18. Account Statements

We will make all logs and records of activities concerning your Account available to you through our mobile application only. We do not generate periodic statements showing the activity on your Account. You must examine these logs and records and notify us of any unauthorized use or any error or irregularity on your Account within fourteen (14) calendar days after the error occurs. If notice is not received within the fourteen (14) calendar-day period, you will not be able to raise any further claim in this respect.

19. Conversion Rates

Any conversion between a Digital Asset and another Digital Asset shall be made by us in accordance with the rates and prices applicable at the actual time of conversion. Applicable rates are indexed to those used by industry-leading platforms, as we may choose to use from time to time, in our sole discretion. We currently use rates provided by (CMC Markets)[https://coinmarketcap.com], (Coinpaprika)[https://coinpaprika.com] and our own rates as determined by our liquidity providers. We may change these rate sources at any time and without giving prior notice or updating these Terms, and you shall not have any claims regarding our choice of rate sources or rates made available by any third party.

20. Closing an Account

(i) Celsius Right to Account Closure- We have the right to close your Account at any time for any reason without advance notice. If your Account has a balance when we close it, we will return the remaining Digital Assets to you, including accrued rewards earned until the close date, less any applicable penalty, withholding tax and other applicable deductions, unless prohibited by applicable law. In the event of irregular activity, we may hold your assets until we close your account. Any Digital Assets that Celsius returns to you will be sent to the designated withdrawal addresses in your user profile on the Celsius platform for each respective Digital Asset you hold. Accounts are not transferable or assignable in whole or in part. Celsius may be required by law to turn over the assets in abandoned or unclaimed customer accounts to the state of your last known residence (“Escheatment”). Escheatment periods vary by jurisdiction, and you are responsible to determine the applicability of such laws in your place of residence. Celsius reserves the right to deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed or abandoned Digital Assets, as permitted by applicable law.

(ii) Right to Close Your Account-  If you want to terminate your Account with Celsius, you may do so by notifying Celsius at support@celsius.network. Once your Celsius Account is closed, you agree: (a) to continue to be bound by these Terms, as required by Section 36 (Survival) (b) to immediately stop using the Services, (c) that we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of your information and account data stored on our servers, and (e) that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of access to the Services or for deletion of your information or account data. You acknowledge that any legal obligations you may have under any other agreement with Celsius (including any loan agreement or agreement governing lending or investing in Celsius or its affiliates) will not be affected in any way by the termination of the Terms and any such other agreement between you and Celsius will continue to be in effect in accordance with its terms.

21. Liability for Unauthorized Transfers from Your Account

You must notify us IMMEDIATELY via email to security@celsius.network if you believe that an electronic transfer has been made without your permission, or if your statement shows transfers that you did not make. YOU ACCEPT ALL RISKS OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT.

22. Eligible Digital Currency

We may, from time to time and in our sole discretion, add and remove certain Digital Assets from our list of Eligible Digital Currencies. If a Digital Asset is removed, it will no longer be available to be used via our Services. We will notify our Users of our intention to add and/or remove Digital Assets as soon as commercially reasonable. However, under certain circumstances (e.g. for legal reasons) such changes may be required to be made immediately and without prior notice. In the event any Digital Asset ceases to be an Eligible Digital Asset, you will no longer be entitled to receive any rewards accrued on it or make any other use of it via our Services.

23. Disclosure of Account Information

We may disclose information to third parties about you, your Account, or the transfers you make:

    (i) Where it is necessary for the provision of our Services under these Terms;

    (ii) In order to verify the existence and condition of your Account for a third party, such as a referral partner;

    (iii) For the purpose of conducting our AML and KYC checks;

    (iv) If you give us written authorization;

    (v) In order to comply with any request or order by any government agency or competent court; and

    (vi) As described in our Privacy Policy ((https://celsius.network/privacy-policy/)[https://celsius.network/privacy-policy/]). 

24. Conflict/Disputes Involving Your Account

We are not liable to you for errors that do result in a financial loss to you. We may take any action that is authorized or permitted by these Terms without liability to you, even if such action causes you to incur fees, expenses or damages. If third parties make claims on your Account, or if we receive conflicting instructions from you, or if we become involved in or concerned about a dispute between you and any third party, we reserve the right to react in ways that we believe in good faith to be appropriate, including by closing your Account and returning the Digital Assets available therein, or interpleading assets to court. You are liable for all expenses and fees we incur for such conflicts or disputes, including internal costs and attorneys’ fees, and we may charge or deduct them directly from your Account. 

We are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating a transfer, you attest that you are transacting in an Eligible Digital Currency which conforms to the particular Celsius account into which assets are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum wallet address to receive assets, you attest that you are initiating a transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. Celsius incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to Unsupported Currencies sent to a Celsius account or Eligible Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Eligible Digital Currency account. Erroneously transmitted assets will be lost. We recommend customers send a small amount of Eligible Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of Eligible Digital Currency. 

**We reserve the right to limit access to your Accounts, which can include temporarily or permanently removing your Account access via the internet, and/or restricting your Account, and/or closing your Accounts without prior notice to you (unless prior notice is required by law), and we shall have no liability for such actions. In addition, Celsius reserves the right to withhold or delay the transmission of  assets belonging to you if you fail to comply with these Terms. Our total aggregate liability to you for any claim is limited to the face value of the applicable item or transaction, or the actual value of any assets not properly credited or debited.**

25. Legal Process Affecting Accounts

If legal action such as an attachment, garnishment, levy, or other state or federal legal process (**“Legal Process”**) is brought against or in connection with your Account, we may refuse to permit (or may limit) withdrawals or transfers from your Account until the Legal Process is satisfied or dismissed. Regardless of the terms of such Legal Process, we have first claim to any and all assets in your Account. We will not contest any Legal Process on your behalf, and we may take actions to comply with Legal Process without liability to you, provided that we reasonably believe any such action is appropriate under the circumstances. If we incur any expenses in connection with any Legal Process, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, we may charge such expenses and fees to any of your Accounts with us without prior notice to you, or we may bill you directly for such expenses and fees. Any garnishment or levy against your Account is subject to our right of setoff and security interest.

26. Indemnification and Limitation of Liability; Attorney’s Fees and Costs for Lawsuits

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Celsius and its employees, managers, partners and Affiliates from any losses, damages, suits and expenses, of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that we incur in connection with or arising out of your use of your Account and/or the Services, or our activities in connection with such Account, and for your violation of any law, regulation, order or other legal mandate, or the rights of a third party, or any act or omission by you or any person acting on your behalf while using your Account, regardless of whether the specific use was expressly authorized by you. You agree to comply with applicable law and to not use your Account for any transaction or activity that is illegal or violates applicable laws, regulations or rules. Please note, your agreement to comply includes any and all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, as well as of your place of residency and any law applicable to you.

We are not liable to you for claims, costs, losses or damages caused by an event that is beyond our reasonable control (e.g. the acts or omissions of third parties, natural disaster, emergency conditions, government action, equipment or communications malfunction). We are not liable for special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind. Except for any setoff permitted by applicable law and Section 9 of these Terms, any Obligations of ours may be satisfied solely from the assets of Celsius. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall you have any recourse, whether by setoff or otherwise, with respect to our Obligations, to or against any assets of any person or entity other than Celsius for Celsius’ Obligations, including, without limitation, any member, Affiliate, investor, employee, officer, agent or advisor of Celsius. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit any setoff permitted by applicable law and Section 9 of these Terms.
